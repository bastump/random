<h1 class="topictitle1">Overview</h1>

<p>The sample application represents a fictitious online plant store where one can order
and purchase flowers, trees, vegetables, and accessories. You can view an online catalog,
select items, and add them to a cart. When the cart contains items, you can proceed to
log in, supply credit card information, and checkout.</p>

<p>This version of PlantsByWebSphere Ajax Edition has been further enhanced to demonstrate
the computer-telephony integration and Web collaboration widgets included with
IBM&reg; WebSphere&reg; Application Server V8.0. For further information about the enhancements,
see <a href="cea_introduction.html">Introduction to Communications Enabled Applications</a>.</p>

<p>The application serves as an example of a Web application that someone might attempt
to develop. This application contains model, presentation, and controller layers that can
be developed. Additionally, Ajax-style architecture is added through the JavaScript
<a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org" target="_blank">Dojo Toolkit</a>. Specifically, the
use of various Dojo widgets and enablement of drag-and-drop capabilities for the shopping
cart are added. Figure 1.0 illustrates some of the features of the PlantsByWebSphere
application.</p>

<p><img src="./images/plantsbywebsphere_pic.jpg" /></p>

<p>To support drag and drop, a number
of Dojo widget controls were created. The widgets include support for displaying the
inventory in a grid, displaying detail information on the items and dragging items to a
shopping cart. When you click <b>check out</b>, the content of the shopping cart widget
is sent to the server for processing. The grid widget that displays the content of the
catalog derives the information by issuing a request to the server using the
dojo.xhr(Get,Put). The response from the server is sent back in XML format and contains
detail information and a Universal Resource Locator (URL) reference to where the image is
located. Figure 2.0 shows the general components discussed previously.</p>

<h1 class="topictitle1">Server Side</h1>
<p>The PlantsByWebSphere Ajax Edition application also includes
an additional adapter layer using the Remote Procedure Call Adapter (RPCAdapter).
The RPCAdapter library can be used to map traditional J2EE constructs
such as Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs), Web Services, and POJOs
to lightweight constructs such JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or XML data. The data
can easily be consumed and rendered by JavaScript based clients using Dojo.
In the case of PlantsByWebSphere Ajax Edition, the RPCAdapter is used to map client side GET
requests to "legacy" EJB or Servlet session data. The data is returned as XML and used as
input to construct the Dojo widgets within the browser.</p>
