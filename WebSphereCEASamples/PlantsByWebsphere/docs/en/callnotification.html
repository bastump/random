<h1 class="topictitle1">Call Notification</h1>

<p>The CallNotification widget allows a Web user to register for notification of incoming calls, and integrates click-to-call and cobrowsing functionality. To display the CallNotification widget, click the Call Notification link in the PlantsByWebSphere Ajax Edition for CEA banner (masthead). You can also use the following direct link if PlantsByWebSphere Ajax Edition for CEA is running on a local application server that utilizes the default internal HTTP port (9080): <a href="http://localhost:9080/PlantsByWebSphereAjax/callnotification.html">http://localhost:9080/PlantsByWebSphereAjax/callnotification.html</a>. Note that, as with the click-to-call feature, the number must registered with an IP-PBX. Additionally, the IP-PBX to which the number is registered must be configured as a CTI gateway in the CEA settings of the application server on which PlantsByWebSphere Ajax Edition for CEA is running.</p>

<p>To register for call notification, enter your phone number in the My Number field and click the (left-hand) Start Call Notification icon. (SIP phone numbers must be specified in the format sip:userName@hostName, where hostName is the host name or IP address of the IP-PBX.) When a call is directed to your number, the status line will indicate that your phone is ringing. After you answer the phone, the status line will list the party to which you are connected.</p>

<p>At this point, you can initiate a cobrowsing session with the other party by clicking the (middle) Cobrowse icon. After a cobrowsing session is established, a modal collaboration dialog (window) will appear in each browser window. For further information about the collaboration dialog, see the <a href="cobrowse.html">Cobrowse</a> topic. You can also terminate the call by clicking the (right-hand) Hang Up icon.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Note</b>: When evaluating the cobrowsing feature on a single machine, you must utlize two completely separate Web browsers from different vendors; otherwise, results will be unpredictable. For example, do not attempt to create a cobrowsing session that utilizes two tabs within the same instance of a given browser, or even two separate instances of the same browser, for example, Firefox. Always use two different completely separate browsers from different vendors, for example, Firefox and Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari, and so on.</p>
