<h1 class="topictitle1">Two-Way Forms</h1>

<p>The two-way forms feature allows one party, a writer, to complete a form while another party, a reader, verifies that the form is being completed correctly. In a typical scenario, a customer service representative completes an order form while the customer verifies the entries. This feature is demonstrated in the orderinfo.jsp page that is located in the following directory:
<ul>
<li>profile_root/profile_name/installedApps/cell_name/PlantsByWebSphereAjax.ear/PlantsByWebSphere.war</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>To access the orderinfo page, each party <b>must</b> first register and login using the login page. For further information, see the <a href="user_registration.html">User Registration</a> topic. Next, a cobrowsing session must be established. Finally, within the cobrowsing session, the writer must use the Follow Me feature to lead the reader to the checkout page. For further information, see the <a href="cobrowse.html">Cobrowse</a> topic.</p>

<br>
<p>When the form loads, the active party is deemed the writer, and the passive party the reader. When creating a form, a developer can specify whether the writer or reader will be able to edit a particular field. Within this checkout form, the writer can edit the Billing Address, Shipping Address, and Shipping Method fields, and the reader can edit the credit card and payment information fields. The image below shows the writer's checkout form.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Note</b>: When evaluating the two-way forms (cobrowsing) feature on a single machine, you must utlize two completely separate Web browsers from different vendors; otherwise, results will be unpredictable. For example, do not attempt to create a cobrowsing session that utilizes two tabs within the same instance of a given browser, or even two separate instances of the same browser, for example, Firefox. Always use two different completely separate browsers from different vendors, for example, Firefox and Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari, and so on.</p>
